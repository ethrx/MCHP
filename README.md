# Minecraft Honeypot (MCHP)
A trap for Minecraft griefers.
## What a Honeypot does
It is just a "hacker trap". If rats are attracted to cheese, hackers are attracted to Honeypots.

## What this Honeypot does
There are many different types of Honeypots depending on the service you want to setup. This Honeypot is meant to stop hackers that find small servers just to grief them. 
While you could turn on a whitelist, this way wastes the time of a hacker by crashing their game.
## Roadmap
- [] Core functionality (crash the hacker game on join \[after a few seconds to waste their time though\])
- [] Port specification
- [] Feign server with fake/random server info, or duplicate info from another server.
- [] Compile as a binary and release
